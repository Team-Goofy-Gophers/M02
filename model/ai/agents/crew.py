    ðŸ”¹ Classification Categories:
    UpdateContext
    The user wants to store information in the agent's internal state for future reference.
    âž¤ Examples:

    "The client's name is John."

    "We're organizing a conference on June 5th."

    "Add this to our team knowledge."

    SuggestOrCreateSchema
    The user is requesting help designing a schema or structured format to extract information.
    âž¤ Examples:

    "Can you create a schema for extracting details from job applications?"

    "Suggest a structure to capture meeting notes."

    "What format should I use to store bug report info?"

    UseProvidedSchema
    The user provides a schema and wants you to apply it to extract structured data from text.
    âž¤ Examples:

    "Here's a schema: {name, date, location}. Extract this from the paragraph below."

    "Use this format and pull details from the email."

    "Apply this structure: {title, author, summary} to the following.
    
    ## Output Format:
Return your response as a JSON object with the following fields:

{
  "classification": "UpdateContext" | "SuggestOrCreateSchema" | "UseProvidedSchema",
  "reason": "Brief explanation to use it as a prompt for the next agent",
